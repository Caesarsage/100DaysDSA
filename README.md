# 100DaysOfDSA FROM Destiny Erhabor

###### (Method from MichaelCade 90DaysOfDevOps)

This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of Data Structure and Algorithm, alongside solving problems. I will be starting this journey on the Q2, April 2022 but the idea is that we take 100 days.

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources and also improve oneself.

The goal is to take 100 days, 2 hour a day, to tackle over 20 areas of DSA to a foundational knowledge.

This will not cover all things DSA but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
