## Solution thought flow

### Q1 Height Checker

> A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.
You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i]

### Q2 Third Maximum Number
>Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number
