## Choosing a language and platform for solving daily questions

This should sorely be based on your most comfortable stack. T he idea is to learn a problem solving skills NOT programming language solving skills.

There are tons of platform for solving DSA. And for this 100Days we are touching 

- Leetcode
- codechef
- Hackerrank
- Codility

Exhausting their learning path and guided tracks.
